# Flower-Recognition---CNN-Image-Classification
## Introduction
In this repository, our goal is to build a Convolution Neural Network to classify the type of flowers from a total of 5 different categories
<br />
## About the Dataset
The dataset contains 4242 images of flowers collected from data flicr, yandex images, pintrest, google images. All of the images are divided into five categories, namely : chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion. Each image has a resolution of 320 X 240
